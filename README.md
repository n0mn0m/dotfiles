Most files are documented by name and contents, but if you have questions or tips please send me an [email](mailto:n0mn0m@burningdaylight.io).

## Emacs

My emacs uses ~/.emacs.d/init.el to bootstrap and then pulls in a few different org files to configure. The org files contain documentation and are interweaved with lisp code that babel extracts and executes. 

## Python

I like to use ipython for my default shell. My ~/.zshrc and ~/bin/pystrt.py contain some helpers for that

## Git

Handles key config and some useful aliases

## Vim

Some basic settings I like to use no matter where I'm opening vim

Look into gnu stow
Set tmux (or screen) back up
